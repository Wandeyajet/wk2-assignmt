            <p class="profile"><strong>Michael Joseph Jackson</strong>  (August 29, 1958 Gary, Indiana‚ÄîJune 25, 2009 in Los Angeles, California), was an American singer, songwriter and dancer. Dubbed the King of Pop, he is widely regarded as one of the most significant cultural figures of the 20th century and one of the greatest entertainers of all time. He was also known for his philanthropy, charitable fundraising, and lifestyle, residing in a private amusement park he called Neverland Ranch and often becoming the focus of tabloid scrutiny. 
            Jackson's contributions to <em>music, dance, and fashion,</em> along with his publicized personal life, made him a global figure in popular culture for over four decades. 
            Through his group, solo, and family work, he became one of the few artists to have been inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame twice. He was also inducted into the Dance Hall of Fame as the first (and currently only) dancer from the world of pop and rock 'n' roll.
             Jackson's other achievements include 39 Guinness World Records‚Äîincluding one for "Most Successful Entertainer of All Time"‚Äî13 Grammy Awards as well as the Grammy Legend Award and Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award, 26 American Music Awards, 16 World Music Awards and the estimated sale of up 750 million units worldwide. 
             Winning countless awards for his humanitarian endeavors, the singer has been honored by two Presidents of the United States. He has also been named as the artist of "the Decade", "Generation", "Century", and "Millennium" and was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 2002. 
             Jackson has also won hundreds of other awards, making him the most awarded recording artist in the history of popular music.
